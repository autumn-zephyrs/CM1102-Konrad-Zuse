<p> Konrade Zuse originally began building his Z1 computing machine in his parent's basement. The machine never worked as well as intended because of the fact that the parts he was using were not as precise as his designs for the machine. He was able to refine his Z1 machine with funding from the government after the outbreak of war, resulting in the Z2 computing engine. The Z3 computer added a heightened ability for programming on the machine. This was important as the first two machines were functionally similar to basic calculators.<br> </p>

<p> The S-Series of computers were designed by Zuse for use in the military. They would be used on bombs. #### Konrade Zuse originally began building his Z1 computing machine in his parent's basement.

<h2> Plankalkul </h2>

<p> Plankalul was Zuse's own high-level programming language. This was developed because he found working at machine level tedious. It was submitted as his PHD thesis.<br> </p>
