<p> Konrade Zuse was born in Berlin in 1910, which at the time was part of the German Empire. He moved at a young age to East Prussia which became a part of Poland after WWII. Zuse received his university education at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, where he studied to become a civil engineer. Zuse graduated univsersity in 1935, two years after the Nazi Party came into power. After graduating, Zuse went on to work for the Ford Motor Company, and then later the Henschel Aircaft Factory in Sch√∂nefeld. Through this job for Henschel, he gained a fascination with machinery. Zuse was interested in automizing menial tasks as he found performing calculations himself repetitive and boring. This led to a dream for Zuse where a machine would be able do these tasks for him. This led Zuse to develop the Z1 in his parent's basement. The Z1 was a mechanical calculator that, due to the quality of it's parts, never performed as well as it was designed to. <br> </p>



<p> Work as a civil engineer continued for Zuse up intil the outbreak of war in 1939, when he was recruited for military service. This gave Zuse the opportinuty to enter into, as he described, "a Faustian bargain" with the Nazi government. They would subsidize Zuse and supply resources for his research, and if he wanted to continue his research he would have to continue working for the Nazi Party, whom he did not agree with morally. Under this agreement, Zuse developed the Z2 and Z3. The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1, using different materials. The Z3 was a vast improvement over the previous version. It was upgraded to 22-bits and had a sufficient capability for programming. Zuse started working on the Z4 in 1942, but was unable to finish due to the dire state of Germany after the war. After eventually resuming work on the Z4 in 1947, it became the first comercially available digital computer in the world, cementing Zuse's contribution to computer science in history.
